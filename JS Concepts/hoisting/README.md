Hoisting is a javascript mechanism where one can access teh variables and functions even before the initislization/assigning value without getting any error.

It can be possible because the variables are assigned as undefined and functions are assigned as function itself during the memory creation phase in the execution context.

so,

Whenever you can console.log variables before initialisation, it will print as undefined.

Whenever you console.log the functions before initialization, it will print as function itself.

Whenever you call the functions before initialization, it will execute the function because, in the memory creation phase the funciton is assigned as function itself(not as undefined unlike variables)
